Collection Data Types
:::::::::::::::::::::


In addition to the numeric, Boolean, and character types,
C++ also offers built-in collection types.
A **collection** data type is a grouping of some number of other data items
(possibly only zero or one) that have some shared significance
or need to be operated upon together.

Arrays, vectors, strings, sets, and hash tables are among these useful
C++ collection types.
